# RUSSIA-UKRAINE-REDDIT-USERS-SENTIMENT

Since November 5, 2024, former President Donald Trump has consistently expressed concerns over U.S. funding for military aid to Ukraine, emphasizing his priority of addressing domestic issues. This debate escalated on February 28, 2025, when President Trump reacted strongly to President Zelensky's decision to reject a U.S.- or Russia-brokered peace or ceasefire agreement.

Given these developments, we sought to examine public sentiment regarding Russia and Ukraine following the 2024 U.S. presidential election, in which President Trump replaced President Biden.For this analysis, we utilized comments from Reddit users to assess sentiment toward Russia and Ukraine from November 5, 2024, to the latest available date in a dataset sourced from Kaggle, titled Public Opinion on the Russia-Ukraine War (Updated Daily).
